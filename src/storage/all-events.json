Chair yoga increases flexibility, strength and body awareness. The benefits also include muscle toning, reduced stress levels, better breathing habits, better sleep and an overall sense of well-being. Anyone who finds traditional mat yoga too challenging (for any of a myriad of reasons) can benefit. In chair yoga, you do not get up and down from the floor, there is no weight bearing on the wrists and shoulders, and much less risk of falling or injury.</p>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\n<p align=\"justify\">All ages and abilities welcome.
